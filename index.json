This paper presents a memory-efficient, massively parallel algorithm that uses GPUs to find overlaps from large sequencing datasets with a very low probability of false positives. Here we use a Rabin-fingerprint-based indexing method which stores the strings with their fingerprints and uses them to generate the fingerprints of suffixes and prefixes. We then sort these fingerprints in hybrid CPU-GPU memory and stream them in GPU to find matches. Experiments show that our implementation can detect a trillion highly probable overlaps within 1.5 billion DNA fragments in just over two hours. Compared to the existing CPU-based approach, it routinely achieves speedups of 5–15x while having a collision rate of 1 in 20 million.","tags":[],"title":"Memory-Efficient All-Pair Suffix-Prefix Overlaps on GPU","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sayan Goswami","Kisung Lee","Seung-Jong Park"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1606953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606953600,"objectID":"2aa653976e77c4b0150f020b85da36a5","permalink":"https://sayangoswami.github.io/publication/hiper3ga/","publishdate":"2021-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hiper3ga/","section":"publication","summary":"Third-generation DNA sequencing technologies such as single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) and nanopore sequencing have the potential to fill the gaps in the existing genome databases since the raw sequences produced by these machines are much longer than those of previous generations and therefore result in more contiguous assemblies. However, these long reads have a high error rate, which makes the assembly process computationally challenging. Moreover, since existing long-read assemblers are designed to run on a single machine, they either take days to complete or run out of memory on even moderate-sized datasets. In this paper, we present a distributed long-read assembler that can assemble large-scale noisy sequence datasets on thousands of cores, resulting in orders of magnitude faster assembly times. By effectively using the map-reduce computation model with a distributed hash-map, both built using a high-performance active messaging middleware, we can assemble a PacBio human genome dataset with 139 billion base-pairs (about 130 GB) in about 33 minutes (using 2,560 cores) compared to more than 38 hours (using 28 cores) with the current state-of-the-art assembler.","tags":[],"title":"Distributed de novo assembler for large-scale long-read datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shayan Shams","Sayan Goswami","Kisung Lee","Seungwon Yang","Seung-Jong Park"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1530835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530835200,"objectID":"d12bbe192a5125f644fb58d898799f89","permalink":"https://sayangoswami.github.io/publication/icdcs/","publishdate":"2018-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icdcs/","section":"publication","summary":"Our current efforts and ultimate vision to build distributed cyberinfrastructure which integrates big data and deep learning technologies with a variety of data for enhancing public safety and livability in cites","tags":[],"title":"Towards Distributed Cyberinfrastructure for Smart Cities Using Big Data and Deep Learning Technologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sayan Goswami","Kisung Lee","Shayan Shams","Seung-Jong Park"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1527206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527206400,"objectID":"0e1d9bf9de92b419ccd36973a1a6a960","permalink":"https://sayangoswami.github.io/publication/lasagna/","publishdate":"2018-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lasagna/","section":"publication","summary":"A new GPU-accelerated genome assembler called LaSAGNA, which can assemble large-scale sequence datasets using a single GPU by building string graphs from approximate all-pair overlaps.","tags":[],"title":"GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Genome Assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arghya Kusum Das,","Jaeki Hong,","Sayan Goswami","Richard Platania","Kisung lee","Wooseok Chang","Seung-Jong Park","Ling Liu"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1498780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498780800,"objectID":"c099ad599effe86e90d5fc4314e9eb82","permalink":"https://sayangoswami.github.io/publication/cloud/","publishdate":"2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cloud/","section":"publication","summary":"A new system model augmenting Amdahl's second law for balanced system to optimize price-performance-ratio of HPC clusters.","tags":[],"title":"Augmenting Amdahl's Second Law: A Theoretical Model to Build Cost-Effective Balanced HPC Infrastructure for Data-Driven Science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sayan Goswami","Arghya Kusum Das","Richard Płatania","Kisung Lee","Seung-Jong Park"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1481155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481155200,"objectID":"66f646b7e3492e13c2f1a23228d7b12d","permalink":"https://sayangoswami.github.io/publication/lazer/","publishdate":"2017-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lazer/","section":"publication","summary":"A scalable and memory-efficient distributed assembler that uses partitioned de Bruijn graphs to improve memory-to-disk swapping and reduce the network communication enabling the assembly of larger datasets on fewer nodes.","tags":[],"title":"Lazer: Distributed memory-efficient assembly of large-scale genomes","type":"publication"}]
